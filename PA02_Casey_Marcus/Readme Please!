The reason I am submitting so late is due to the fact that my program 
wasn't working with the given data file, my log was still sorting, but was not returning correct val.
So I created a random one and it is working fine..
Kept debugging but am unable to figure out the problem so I just submitted it, 
maybe the reason is obvious but perhaps try with other random data as well besides the given file? 

Thank you.
